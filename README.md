# Hiragana Classifier

A simple neural network-based handwritten Hiragana character recognizer.  
Draw Hiragana characters using a Tkinter-based canvas, and the trained model will classify them.

## 🧠 Features

- Custom neural network built using TensorFlow/Keras
- Simple drawing interface using `tkinter`
- Real-time prediction of hand-drawn Hiragana
- Supports basic characters (e.g. あ, い, う...)

## 🖼️ Interface

The user can draw on a 280x280 pixel canvas. The image is resized and passed to a trained model for prediction.
